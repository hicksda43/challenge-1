# Code Refactor

## Purpose
Refactoring existing website syntax and styles in order to promote Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Site Accessibility

## Motivation
Technology advances, and so should accessibility. Web pages exist to promote YOUR business, and provide information to people like me; who get frustrated not finding what they are looking for within the first three links from a Google Search (And because I am still learning).
